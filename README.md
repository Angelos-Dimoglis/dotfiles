> [!NOTE]
> 
> This is a collection of configuration files that were made for personal use.
> This means that I have made some choices about how I write them.
>
> * snake case over camel case
> * Clean code philosophy
>
> I have made these configurations as clean as I can, both in the code I write
> and in the file structure. Most of the time I break large configuration files
> to smaller more managable modules. I also use the XDG Base Directory
> specification for a cleaner home directory.
>
> Modularity in some areas is not present in these configurations due to my
> choices of the hardware and software I use.
>
> 1. Hardware agnostic configuration
>   * Some parts of the configuration is ment for specific hardware I own, for
>     example my laptop.
>   * I don't have a multi-monitor setup in mind.
>
> 2. **No** multi-shell in mind
>   * I don't see the point in using other shells at the moment.
>
> 3. **No** distro modularity in mind
>   * I use Debian and Debian derivatives.
