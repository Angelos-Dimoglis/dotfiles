## About This Repository

> [!CAUTION]
> My configs may cause undesirable effects on other systems. Make sure you read
> and understand every file you use and modify it to suit your needs.

The purpose of this repository is to house my personal configurations of the 
software I use. In the following sections I will describe the **values** of 
engineering and the **goals** of this project.

### Clean Code Principles

I value systems that are **modular**, **maintainable** and **scalable** and 
that's why I prefer to break up my configs to small files with sections as 
opposed to monolithic giant files. I also try to write programs that are as
**readable** and **predictable** so they can be understood and **maintained**.

To minimize the configuration directories generated by the software I use, the
[XDG base directory 
specification](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory) is followed 
as it can be seen in my `.bashrc`

> [!NOTE]
> Even though I put an emphasis to **modularity** to this setup I haven't taken
> into consideration:
> * Multiple shells (I don't use anything other than bash because they are not 
> used in the industry)
> * Multiple monitors in different configurations (I believe it would be very 
> difficult to write generic code to cover this so I try to make my configs as 
> customizable as possible)

### Minimalism

I value **minimal**, **elegant** software that **performs well**, works **in
conjunction** with other programs and use **text** as an interface (basically
the values that describe the [Unix
philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)). Based on this
philosophy I can avoid **bloated**, **large** and **convoluted** software. Also 
(most of the time) minimal software allows me build **efficient** workflows.

So in summary I want software that:
* uses CPU and memory efficiently
* has a CLI or TUI interface (over GUI applications)
* has keyboard-centric control (using vim keybinds)
* is scriptable

### Privacy And Security

I value secure, [Free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and [Open
Source](https://opensource.org/osd) software. Well engineered secure software
will preserve my **freedom**, **privacy** and **independence** from any
vendor/company that decides to control data and/or spy on me for profit.

### Reproducibility

I value a setup that is **hardware and distro agnostic**. I believe that have 
this kind capability will show it's benefits when I decide to migrate to other 
machines and/or Linux distributions. At first I planed to implement this with
primitive basic tools (bash, git, stow, rsync, cron) but I'm in the process of
learning and using [Ansible](https://www.redhat.com/en/ansible-collaborative), 
an automation tool used in the industry.

## Unimplemented Features And Fixes

* fallback fonts
* GPU generated graphics
* Bluetooth support (status bar module)
* Ethernet support (status bar module)
* various TODO and FIX comments are scattered in some configs
